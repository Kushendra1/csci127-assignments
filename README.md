To create this Readme file:
Use mkdir to create the "quiz-01" directory.
Change into the directory using the "cd directory_name" command.
Use the "touch filname" command to create a file- filename is just a stand in name.

To push Readme:
First add Readme.md to the staging area using "git add filename"
Then commit the file by using "git commit -a -m" with a comment in quotes describing what you did.
Finally use the "git push" command to push it up to github.
