As of right now, I am having toruble understanding exactly what it is that the
Lady bug problem wants me to do. I have asked some classmates and friends to 
explain it to me but I am still unclear. I will try to get this problem
solved by Monday. The instructions are just a bit unclear to me.

UPDATE:
I have tried to split the function into multiple functions. The first will 
determine the colors and amount of times the colors appear in the inputs, and
in the second I will try to have it determine whether or not colors can switch
places with other and with spaces to make the lady bugs happy. That I have not
yet figured out.
