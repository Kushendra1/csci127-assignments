UPDATE:
I have tried to split the function into multiple functions. The first will 
determine the colors and amount of times the colors appear in the inputs, and
in the second I will try to have it determine whether or not colors can switch
places with other and with spaces to make the lady bugs happy. That I have not
yet figured out. 

UPDATE 2:
I have written a code that has my general idea with the help of some classmates.
However, it is encountering some errors that I can't seem to understand.
The gist of the code is as follows. The happy function should simply determine
whether or not two side by side objects are the same and thus happy, as the 
problem describes. To do so it needs to run through each item of the string,
and that is where the count function comes in. Since I do not know how to determine
if two things are equal pass the first two objects, the count function helps
me split the code. THen finally, the HappyLadyBug function should bring it all
together and produce the yes/no answer. I will try to figure out the errors by
Monday.
